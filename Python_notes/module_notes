# Basics of Programming 

### Server : 
- Powerful computers that store data, runs programs & deliver information to other computers(user) over internet.

### Cloud :  
- The cloud simply means using internet to store data or run programs rather than using your own computer.

### Cloud Computing : 
- Using computing services( like storage, software and processing power) over internet instead of using it on your own computer.

Key Concept :

- Scale up & scale down according to requirement.

* Significance : 

- Cost saving (no upfront cost for hardware , rent infrastructure insted of buying Servers)

- Top 10 cloud :
- AWS, Azure, Alibaba cloud , Google cloud,  Salesforce, Dell, IBM.

### Cloud Services Model :
- Deliver software application over the internet , fully managed by provider.

- Three main model of cloud services :

1. laas(infrastructure as a service): Provide virtual machines, storage & networking on rent. 
    - Amazon EC2, VM, Microsoft Azure.
    - Use when we need basic IT services like storage, servers and networking.

2.  Paas(Platform as a service): Provide a readymade platform with tools, database and runtime no server managment needed.

    - Google app engine, Azure App services, Heroku.
    - Used by developer to build, test and deploy apps easily.

3. Saas(Software as service) : Provide complete software directly through the Web. 
    - Gmail, Google docs, Dropbox, Netflix.
    - Use by end user to access readymade apps via internet.


#### Memory map:
 - Iaas(): Rent Hardware, 
 - Paas(): Build apps
 - Saas() : Use apps    

 ### How coputer & programming language works : 

 - CPU Execute instructions (perform logic and calculation)

 #### Memory Types :

 - Primary Memory :

   1. RAM: 
    - Temporarily stores data and program 
    - Volatile(RAM is initialize when we restart the computer)




   2. ROM: 
    - Stores essential programs like(BIOS/ Firmware)
    - Runs essential program to load operating system 
    - Nonvolatile

    3. SSD : 
     - Flash memory
    
    4. HDD : 
     - Magnetic disk

    5. USB:
     - Flash memory



#### High Level Programming Language : 

- Language are easy to write code by humans 
    - python, java, c++.



#### Low level language :
 - Machine level language that is close to machine code gives direct control over hardware.
    - Binary, assembly,

Tools to use translate HLPL TO LLPL :
1. Interpreter :

- Translate and execute code line by line, during runtime.
    - Python, JavaScript, Ruby.
    - Slow, error handling at a time 



2. Compiler : 
- Translate entire program into machine code before execution  
 - Detect all error at once C, C++, Rust, Go 
 - Create separate execute files

### How python code executes :

- Write python code in .py files 
- Interpreter compiles into bytecode --> .pyc files.
- This bytecode is executed by python virtual machine(PVM)

 - So python is Compiled to bytecode.
 - Them interpreted by PVM .
  - That's why python often called Compiled-interpreted language. 


## Algorithms and Flowcharts : 

### Algorithms :
- Breaking down tasks into steps known as algorithm 

- Sequence of steps to solve the problem 

### Pseudocode:
- Pseudocode is plain language way to describe steps of an algorithms without using actual programming syntax
